# Queue

### Objective

In this project, we will cover the fundamentals of the queue.

### Problem

Create a `queue` class using an array-based approach.

### Implementation

Write the implementation of the `queue` class to store the invoice number.

1. Create a `queue `class using an array-based approach that contains two methods: enQueue and display.
2. The `enQueue` method allows to add a new element.
3. The `display` method print all element in the queue.

> Run the main method to verify the implementation.

````Java
public class QueueArray {
  /*add your code here*/
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        QueueArray queueArray = new QueueArray();

        queueArray.enQueue(100);
        queueArray.enQueue(101);
        queueArray.enQueue(102);
        queueArray.display();
    }
}
